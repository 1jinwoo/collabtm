A sample session with the Movielens dataset. The dataset has 1M
ratings, 6K movies and 4K users. The Gamma Poisson recommendation
model was fit with 100 latent factors. For more details, see
movielens-dataset-README.

1. Load the training set and the model fit

  load("users.rda")
  load("titles.rda")

  load("beta.rda")
  load("theta.rda")

  source("mlens.R")

2. Show the top movies from the top factors of a movie

   show_related_movies("Carrie")

3. Show the top movies of a factor

   k <- 1
   top_movies_by_factor(k)

   Most factors appear reasonable but notice that factor 16 captures
   movies mostly from the year 2000. Any ideas?

4. Show the top movies of a user

   myuser <- sample(users$userid, 1)
   show_top_movies(myuser)

   Try myuser <- 4523.

4. Show the top factors of a user

   show_top_user_factors(myuser)

   Some of the shown factors may not play a big role. Check the
   relative weights shown in the bar plot.
